# Wishee

This is an Android application still within development stage. The aim is to allow users share wishes among their friends.

## Dependencies

- Picasso `com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.5.2`
- CircleImageView library `de.hdodenhof:circleimageview:2.0.0`
- Android Image Cropper `com.theartofdev.edmodo:android-image-cropper:2.3.1`
- Firebase `com.google.firebase:firebase-core:9.6.1`
- Firebase Database `com.google.firebase:firebase-database:9.6.1`
- Firebase Auth `com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:9.6.1`
- Firebase UI `com.firebaseui:firebase-ui-database:0.6.1`
- Facebook SDK `com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:4.16.1`

For development, the newest Android SDK was used. Before production phase changes may occur.

## Motivation

The ultimate goal was to create my first Android application with accounts and entire user experience. The app will probably be published at Google Play after completely finished.

## UX

Users basically can:

- Login via Facebook OAuth2
- Add wishes to personal wishlist
- Browse wishlists of Facebook friends
- Suggest buying a present to a person
- Get notified if a person wants to buy them a present
